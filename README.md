# Font comparison tool

I made this tool to compare a bunch of local fonts side-by-side. This wasn’t built for public consumption, so it’s just got a bunch of font definitions from [Atipo Foundry](https://www.atipofoundry.com/) hardcoded in. Remix it however you want.

I didn’t include the fonts in the repo. If you [buy them from Atipo](https://www.atipofoundry.com/), copy them to `./public/fonts`.

## Get started

```
git clone git@github.com:rileyjshaw/font-comparison-tool
cd font-comparison-tool
yarn install
# Copy the Atipo fonts into ./public/fonts,
# or add some of your own local fonts into the `defaultFonts` array in `App.js`
yarn start
```

## Where is the rest of the documentation?

Sorry, I haven’t written any! [Here’s a quick screen recording instead.](https://youtu.be/TRGodGOu3Ww)
